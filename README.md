# SGPA & CGPA Calculator

The SGPA & CGPA Calculator is an experimental web application developed to calculate semester and cumulative grade point averages for MCA students of VTU belonging to the 2022-2024 batch. This application allows students to input their marks for each subject and calculate their SGPAs for all semesters, as well as their overall CGPA. It acts as an online calculator for this specific purpose.

As this is an early experimental version, there may be bugs and inaccuracies in the calculations. We welcome user feedback to help improve the tool.
